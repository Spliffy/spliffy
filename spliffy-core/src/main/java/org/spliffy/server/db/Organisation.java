/**
 * An organisation contains users and websites. An organisation can have a parent
 * organisation which represents actual ownership, or administrative control within
 * the context of this system.
 * 
 * For example, a business might have child organisations for its departments or
 * branches. Or a business might have child organisations for its customers, meaning
 * that the parent organsiation has administrative control of the customers within
 * this application.
 * 
 * An organisation with no parent is the root organisation. It is only permissible
 * to have a single root organisation. This will generally be the org which owns
 * and operates the computer system
